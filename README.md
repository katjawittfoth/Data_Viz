# How dangerous are sharks?
Data Visualization Final Project. I'm analyzing shark attacks data from [Global Shark Attack File](http://www.sharkattackfile.net/)

## Few insights:
Most people are afraid of sharks, and there's a misconception that if you are in the water with them you are in deep trouble. The idea that sharks are killing machines preying on humans is a myth that I learned to overcome after I became an avid scuba diver. Iâ€™m often diving in the murky waters of Northern California, which is famous for its large population of White Sharks, so I wanted to learn more about real risks.

Generally, shark attacks are increasing, though the fatal attacks are staying at the same level throughout the century. 
You can see a peak of attacks around 1960. The peak happens in the USA and Australia, driven by surfing starting to get popular in the 60s.

If we break all the shark attackss from 1900 till 2017 by the activity and county, surfing in the USA and Australia seems to be by far the most dangerous activity. The reason for that is that sharks often mistake surfers or humans splashing in the water for prey.
