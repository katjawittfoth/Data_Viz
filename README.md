## How dangerous are sharks and is all the fear people have justified?
Analyzing shark attacks data from [Global Shark Attack File](http://www.sharkattackfile.net/)

Most people are afraid of sharks, and there's a misconception that if you are in the water with them you are in deep trouble. The idea that sharks are killing machines preying on humans is a myth that I learned to overcome after I became an avid scuba diver, but I've only had two encounters with sharks so far. Iâ€™m often diving in the murky waters of Northern California, which is famous for its large population of White Sharks, so I wanted to learn more about the attacks and real risks.

### Dataset
I am using shark attack incidents dataset from Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks. This data was compiled by the Global Shark Attack File.
